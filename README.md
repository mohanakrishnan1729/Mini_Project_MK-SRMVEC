## Introduction
In today's digital era, ensuring the security and confidentiality of sensitive information during transmission is paramount. Traditional encryption methods, while essential, can be vulnerable to attacks. This project integrates steganography techniques to enhance data transmission security by embedding confidential data within images, creating a multi-layered security framework.

## Objectives
- Improve the security of data transmission processes.
- Embed classified data within innocuous digital files such as images.
- Prevent unauthorized access to transmitted data.
- Establish protocols for encoding, transmission, and decoding of steganographically embedded data.
- Strengthen the security of military and government communications.
- Explore steganographic methods and their effectiveness.
- Conduct rigorous testing to verify the reliability and effectiveness of the steganography framework.

## Methodology
The project methodology includes:
- Analysis of various steganographic algorithms and methodologies.
- Development of a prototype steganographic tool using MATLAB.
- Implementation of encryption and decryption algorithms.
- Evaluation of embedding techniques against steganalysis methods.
- Detailed working procedures and flowcharts.

## Results and Discussion
The results section includes outputs from key generation, encryption, and decryption processes, as well as the final steganographic outputs. Discussion focuses on the robustness and effectiveness of the implemented techniques.

## Conclusion and Future Scope
The project successfully demonstrates the potential of image steganography for secure data transmission. Future work may explore advanced steganographic techniques, integration with other security protocols, and broader applications beyond military communications.
